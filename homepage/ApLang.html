            <h1>New Yorker by Blood</h1>
            <br>
            <p>You are what makes New York City my home. Your pungent smell from incense burning in bunches, creating the light smoke that dresses your sky. Your UFO-shaped subway entrance with multiple labels reading Union Square along the ring. The castle wall design for the ground and how it’s dotted by small merchants. The light and muffled chatter that never says too quiet or too crowded. The walls around you are full of windows, gold lights gleaming outwards. Yet Few New Yorkers will be able to stop and admire your beauty. They will only see the surface level, the train stop where most train lines intersect. Just another insignificant place New Yorkers pass by. Consumed by their new phones, clean new shoes, or the hyperfocus all New Yorkers have on their destination. Thus making clear they never stepped foot in New York or took the time to appreciate the beauty of the city. Never come to terms with the culture of the sewage water and cigarette buds as they constantly chose to ignore, complain, or change the city, rather than embrace it. New Yorkers were purposely altered to be infatuated with change in the city and themselves, as that’s what keeps the city so fast-paced and progressive. Without these “imperfections” New York isn’t New York. To consistently ignore everything or classify weird as normal is merely oversimplifying the city. New York is weird and that’s what makes it New York. One can’t identify this city as normal without classifying every other city in the world as weird.
                Most New Yorkers would consider your stores boring. Maybe it’s because it’s something they’ve seen before or maybe because they’ve seen something better. They just see Staples, Mcdonald's, Barnes & Nobles, and so on. I see the free air conditioning when it’s too hot, an easy choice for food when with friends, and a place to relax with free water when money is tight. I see the memories in everything around me that tie us together. When I see the park I don’t just see a park. I see where I had my first-ever date on a cold winter Saturday night. I remember waiting there, my hand turning into a dry ice sculpture, holding the rose I had bought for my date. How I never felt truly alone because you were with me, sheltering me with your trees as my veins were flooded with anxiousness up until she had finally arrived.
                So even as the scenery changes my love for you is engraved in my soul. Even as you attract more people, stink more of trash, and change what you offer. Even as you are influenced by the New York genes to require change, my memories will forever hold you as a symbol; you are the mix between the calm and fast-paced New York. The split between those oblivious to your beauty, whether the New Yorkers that constantly sped around you or the ones who came to bask in your presence. How you remained average yet distinctive. How you never had to rely on big screens or colored lights like Times Square. How your music was quieter and less often than Washington Square Park, yet still played seamlessly with the environment whenever added. I see the meaning, the intricacy, hidden in your seemingly simplistic design. You are what I long for, what makes New York City my home. Nevertheless, I can’t stay with you forever; I will always carry you in my heart but just like you, I’m a New Yorker by blood.</p>
